# Audio360: "Facebook360 Spatial Workstation" ffmpeg Binaries for WINDOWS
Installing audio360, ffmpeg is missing. You had to do cumbersome operations to get it in. Now just "copy  and paste" the code I posted here. As said: it is valid for Windows

download the entire dir

*ffmpeg-3.2-win64-shared*

copy it into:

*C:\ProgramData\FB360 Spatial Workstation*

So that the whole stuff will be:

*C:\ProgramData\FB360 Spatial Workstation\ffmpeg-3.2-win64-shared*

Run FB360. Enjoy


# NOTE:

This is the compiled version rpopsoed here:
https://facebookincubator.github.io/facebook-360-spatial-workstation/KB/ManualFFmpegInstallation.html

Which is the verison **3.2 MANDATORY for FB360 Encoder.exe**. Inded thepath above carries out the path version.
So: jsut to isntall the more recente **ffmpeg**, and enabling them inhto the PATH of Windows: doesn't work at all!

To propose to people, normally Audio Engineers, to become IT Specialsits for 1 day, to compile the code, in order to be able to us e it: is not only crazy but also out of any mind and totally unacceptable!

"*facebookincubator*" could compile the binaries and give them to people instead to waste time turn people into "system engineers for one day".

Hence, I decided to failitate the life of everybody,providing the fiished code.
All what you have to do it: download it and install it as I said above.


**I'm SAD** i can't give you at teh moment the compiled code for Apple. Te day  I can compile it, I will provide it to you.
