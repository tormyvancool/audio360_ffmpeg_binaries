# Audio360: FB30 Spatial Workstation ffmpeg Binaries for WINDOWS
Installing audio360, ffmpeg is missing. you had to do cumbersome operations to get it in. Now just "copy  and paste" the code I posted here.is valid for Windows

download the entire dir

*ffmpeg-3.2-win64-shared*

copy it into:

*C:\ProgramData\FB360 Spatial Workstation*

So that the whole stuff will be:

*C:\ProgramData\FB360 Spatial Workstation\ffmpeg-3.2-win64-shared*

Run FB360. Enjoy
